# Mediafly Interactives

## Install

### Option 1: Global install (if you are not using build tools such as gulp)

Enter the following in the terminal

```
$ npm install -g mfly-interactive
```

Run in the folder where the Interactive is located.


	$ mfly-interactive serve


### Option 2: Local install (if you have gulp, grunt, etc. with a static file server)

This package can also be used as a node.js middleware. You can plug in this middleware in the static file server responsible for serving up your Interactive.


Enter the following in the terminal


	$ npm install mfly-interactive --save-dev


Here is an example of how to set up a [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) server. The same can be done with any connect server as well. Here, the middleware provided by `mfly-interactive` can be supplied to your server.


	var browserSync = require("browser-sync")
	var options = require('./mfly-interactive.config.json')
	//Viewer slug is required here
	options.slug = '{VIEWER_SLUG}'
	var viewerMiddleware = require('mfly-interactive')(options)
	
	browserSync({
		files: 'app/**',
		https: true,
		server: {
			baseDir: './app',
			middleware: [
				viewerMiddleware
			]
		}
	})

## Initialize

1. Upload the Interactive into Airship
2. Run `mfly-interactive init`. See [Explanation for required parameters](#Explanation for required parameters) for details on how to find information requested by this command.

Note: The `init` command creates `mfly-interactive.config.json` at the root of your Interactive. `mfly-interactive.config.json` contains Airship user specific information. Be sure to add it to your `.gitignore` file.

**Please note that local changes to the Interactive will not update the uploaded Interactive. When finished making changes, you will need to upload the Interactive in Airship again.**

## Testing Interactives on iOS (Availability: iOS (662))

mfly-interactive can speed up testing of Interactives on iOS. Specifically it provides the following 2 features:

1. Interactives will live reload in the iOS app upon file save.
2. JavaScript `console` messages from the iOS WebView will be shown in the terminal.

Steps to set this up:

1. Ensure `mfly-interactive serve` command is running.
2. Open the iOS app and tap the "Settings" icon on the bottom toolbar and tap "About".
3. Tap the title bar of the About modal dialog rapidly (more than 10 times). At this point you will see the "DEVELOPER!" modal window.
4. Enter the IP address and port from the "External" URL that is shown in your terminal that is running mfly-interactive. Now the app is configured to use the mfly-interactive proxy. The main title bar of the app will display the IP address and port.
5. Navigate to the specific Interactive you are working on. Long tap the item.
6. Select "Add to proxy" from the context menu.
7. Open the Interactive.

Now you are set to test the Interactive on iOS. Open the "DEVELOPER!" modal by following steps 1-3 to turn off the proxy.

## Publishing an Interactive

	$ mfly-interactive publish
